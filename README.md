**Q: Can I compress multiple fonts at once?**

A: Currently, woofwoof supports one font compression at a time. We recommend compressing fonts individually for better results.

A: Once a font is compressed into WOFF2, you cannot revert it back to the original format. It's best to keep a backup of the original font file.
